At liftoff, the stage's five F-1 rocket engines ignite and produce 7.5 million pounds of thrust. To replace those goofy quantities with the far less retarded metric system (even though liters are considered part of the metric system they are the same as cubic deci-meters) you would say 770 cubic meters of kerosene {abbreviated as m3} and 1,204 m3 of liquid O2 [O2 is the symbol for oxygen]. We would also say it produced 33,600,000 newtons of force <abbreviated as N>. To add scientific notation {a way of writing numbers that allows you to write only as many digits of specificity as you would like} you can write 7.7 * 10 ^ 2 m3 of kerosene 1.204 * 10 ^ 3 m3 of O2 and 3.3 * 10 ^ 7 newtons.\"\n...     assert oddFrequencyCounter(paragraph) == 40\n","hidden":false,"locked":false},{"code":">>> points: 1\n>>> \n>>> def test_oddFrequencyCounter(oddFrequencyCounter):\n...     paragraph = 'Data Science Africa in collaboration with The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), ETH Zurich, EPFL, the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), the Swiss National Computing Centre (CSCS), and the LUMI consortium launched the International Computation and AI Network (ICAIN) at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2024 in Davos.
